# Redshift Control

A better UI for controlling redshift behaviour without having to restart it every 5 minutes. Written in Scala with the java Gtk3 bindings. 

## Project goals

The idea is to have a UI similar to "f.lux" on MacOS which allows you to enter transitional curves, graphs as well as easily manage presets for you. The first revision of this UI will not be anywhere near as powerful but hopefully provide a nicer way to interact with redshift without editing config files and having to restart redshift.

The tool is written in Scala as a way for me to learn the language, using the Java bindings to Gtk3+

More things are to come :)
